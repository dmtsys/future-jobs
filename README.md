## Prerequisites

**Summary:** `node.js` and `git`. You can skip to the next section if you already have these.

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) spectacular platform. LTS (Long-term support) is the right choice for most.

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) incredible version control (needed in the background to install some dependencies on first install).

**Optional:** if you want easy switching between different `node.js` versions in the future and you are using **unix based systems** (macOS, Linux), you can install `node.js` via fantastic [n](https://github.com/tj/n) (don't download it from *nodejs.org* in this
case).

You can also install both `node.js` and `git` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) friendly package manager for macOS. [n](https://github.com/tj/n) is still recommended for `node.js` though.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (Node Package Manager) is installed automatically with `node.js` install (just FYI).

## Install future-jobs just for use

In **Terminal** (Linux, macOS) or **Command Prompt** (Windows) type:

``npm install -g future-jobs``

# unique one direction researcher
